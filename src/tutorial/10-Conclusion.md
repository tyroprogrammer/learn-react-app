Congratulations and thank you for sticking till the end. Hope you enjoyed the tutorial and this tutorial helped you get off the ground with some React fundamentals.
This tutorial is by no means a comprehensive one. I have tried to cover some grounds on the most basic fundamentals you must know about React.

If you liked this tutorial please feel free to share this with others who are trying to learn React. If there are anything you didn't like or was confusing please feel free to drop a note or create a PR. Needless to say your suggestion would help several other folks trying to learn React.

## What's next?

As with anything in software engineering, the best way to learn is by doing. I hope in this tutorial you were able to do the exercise on each section and also complete the capstone project at the end. Next step is to create your own application and starting fiddling with it. The easiest way to get going is by using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). With this you don't have to waste a single minute doing any configuration/setup to create a new react application. Everything is done for you and done extremely well.

## Resources

The best place to find further details on any given React related topic is the official [React website](https://reactjs.org/). That's a highly valuable resources and you'll find yourself refering to this website even long after you are comfortable with React.

If you think you need to go through some other material before you feel more confident about React, there are couple important sections in React website that I think are highly valuable especially during your early days:

- Go to [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and go through the "Main concept" sections. The content in that section is similar to what we discussed here in this tutorial but there might be useful nuggets of information that I have missed here.
- Go through the [official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) in the React website.

There are several other resources that I mentioned during the tutorial and some I haven't mentioned:

- [Lifecycle method reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#commonly-used-lifecycle-methods)
- [Why is setState function asynchronous?](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11527#issuecomment-360199710)
- [How does setState know what to do?](https://overreacted.io/how-does-setstate-know-what-to-do/)
- [ES6 method binding](https://cmichel.io/es6-class-methods-differences/)

Again this is not an exhaustive list and I am sure there are plenty of other good resources on the web. If you find any resources that you think will be useful for begineers please [create a PR](https://github.com/tyroprogrammer/learn-react-app) 😊. 

Happy coding and good luck!
